# SIR Simple Modelling
SIR (Susceptible, Infectious, Recovered) is a epidemiological model using to predict how an infectious disease spread with such numbers of quantities representing the number of people suspected, infected and recovered.
Below is the image showing how we simulate an infectious disease using SIR 

# Mathematical Equations
For more detail, please visit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology#The_SIR_model_without_vital_dynamics, I'm using euler method to solve those differential equations

# How-to-run 
It's just require Python and Matplotlib library to run, to install Matplotlib using the below command
```
$ pip install matplotlib
```
Then just run main.py
